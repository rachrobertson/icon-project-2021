    <p>New Yorkers are torn about the United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan. </p>
    <p>Yesterday afternoon President Biden addressed the nation following the completion of an evacuation of more than 120,000 individuals from Afghanistan—including 5,500 US citizens. The final flights out of Kabul Airport indicated the end of the longest war in the history of the United States. Despite criticism, Biden defended the mission as a success for evacuating more than double the number of people experts estimated possible. </p>

    <p>“It’s about time they got out of there, that’s not our war,” said Angel Santiago, a 55 year old handyman. “We went to somewhere that wasn't none of our business. A lot of our troops died, a lot of Americans, for what?”</p>
   
    <p>Maho Omatani, a 39 year old hotel concierge, was less certain that US withdrawal was completely positive. “Initially I thought it was a good thing,” said Omatani, “and then I saw... pictures of people trying to like grab onto like a plane that's taking off. It was heartbreaking to see it, so I’m mixed.”</p>

    <p>While the evacuation culminated in a 17-day push, the wheels were turning when Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban to have the United States out of Afghanistan by May 1st. This agreement before Biden took office, and the Biden administration pushed the deadline back to August 31st.</p>

    <p>Adam Lavacuente, 41, expressed frustration at the general lack of clarity, but ultimately supported the president’s decision. “I think that the American people shouldn't get mad at Biden, because it wasn't Biden's call to get them out of it, it was actually President Trump's call that got them out of there.”</p>

    <p>Biden repeatedly stated that the evacuation mission was to help others “not in a mission of war, but in a mission of mercy.” </p>

    <p>Construction project manager Paul Greves, 46, did not see the evacuation as a black and white issue. “Well it definitely wasn't a mission of war, he wouldn’t have taken our guys out so he wasn't lying about that. Of course mercy, I'm not sure what he means by that. Is he being merciful to our troops? It didn't seem like it. Maybe just to get the hell out and get them out of the quagmire.”</p>
